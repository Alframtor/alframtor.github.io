### Context
This project addresses the analysis of RNA-seq data from the study by McClain et al. (GEO: GSE161731), which includes peripheral blood samples from individuals with COVID-19, bacterial infections, and healthy controls.

The primary objective was to perform a complete differential expression analysis pipeline to identify the genes and biological processes involved in the specific response to COVID-19.
